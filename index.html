          <div>The Nature Defense Foundation grew out of the reorganization of a larger family foundation, the Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation, originally founded by Martha Gerbode in San Francisco. Since the 1960's the Gerbode Foundation generously supported nonprofit organizations for the benefit of the arts, education, environment, health and civil rights.<br><br>
          In 2015 the Wallace Alexander Gerbode Foundation Board of Directors decided that it was time to pass the torch onto the next generation of family members, six of Martha Gerbode's grandchildren, in order that they may individually steward their grandmother's mission into the future. The Nature Defense Foundation is a product of the Gerbode Foundation's reorganization and it aims to carry Martha's passion for environmental protection into the future. </div>

        <div class="block_inner">
          <div>The campaign for signatures collection under the petition “Save the forest for people and salmon!” addressed to the Government of the Russian Federation has been launched in the Amur River basin. WWF-Russia Amur branch believes: in order to be heard by higher authorities every person’s voice is important to protect riparian forests and salmon.<br><br>
          In the International Year of Salmon-2019, over 50 million hectares of riparian forests that preserve fish stocks, including salmon, are under threat of clearcut logging in Russia. Under the new Federal Law, the size of riparian forests is reduced from 1 km to 50-200 meters. As a result, the total area of floodplain forests will decrease by more than 10 times, which will lead to degradation of the spawning grounds of Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon, sturgeon, whitefish and other valuable fish species. </div>

        <div class="block_inner">
          <div>The long-awaited eight-part documentary series Our Planet becomes available on Netflix globally today. From the creator of Planet Earth, Silverback Films and in collaboration with WWF, the series features never-before-seen footage of wildlife and their habitats while also revealing why the natural world matters to us all and what steps must be taken to preserve it.<br><br>
          WWF believes that we need to overcome a lack of widespread awareness of the crisis our planet is facing A new survey shows that only half (49% ) of people across 10 of the world’s most biodiverse countries are very convinced biodiversity -- our ‘safety net’ or ‘web of life’ -- is in decline. Just 39% realise that we depend on nature and biodiversity for key elements of life, such as food, water and clean air.</div>

        <div class="block_inner">
          <div>It is customary to call «green» a stable and flexible economy that creates more favorable conditions for people’s lives without causing significant damage to the environment. In fact, green economy implies growth in production with a reduction in energy costs, improving the quality of life while reducing the resources used and the burden on ecosystems. There are no contradictions in this approach considering that an infinite increase in the consumed natural resources is impossible, and the division of resources into exhaustible and inexhaustible proves to be very conditional in the detailed study of the issue.<br><br>
          The concept of ecosystem services is closely related to the notion of natural capital, which refers to the totality of living organisms and resources of the biosphere. An assessment of ecosystem services provides a clear picture of the real value of flora and fauna as elements of natural capital as opposed to the market price of individual natural resources.</div>
